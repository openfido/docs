### User Track

[User Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7mXK5MMCAU&amp;index=2)
Episode 1 of the User track covers more in-depth use cases for the OpenFIDO platform, and will take a prospective user through several examples of analyses and functions of the application.

Planned follow-on videos will take users through advanced functionality of the pipelines, including selecting and running pipelines outside of the organization, and using our public templates for building their own pipelines. They will also cover pulling and using the OpenFIDO CLI for locally-hosted use cases, and using the local database backups.

### Developer Track

[Developer Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtIn1v3utfo&amp;index=2)
Episode 1 of the Developer track will take a new developer through building the entire OpenFIDO application locally. Videos in this track will receive minimal editing, to allow for developers to fully follow the process.

Planned Follow-on videos will cover the CI/CD process, using Terraform to deploy to AWS, and building the dockerhub image of OpenFIDO for the CLI tool.
